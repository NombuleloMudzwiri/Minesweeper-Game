# Minesweeper-Game

This is a Minesweeper puzzle game where you count the number of adjacent hashes around each dash.

## Overview

This project aims to create a puzzle game on a grid where the player must count the number of adjacent hash symbols ('#') for each dash symbol ('-'). The grid is represented as a 2D list, and the game logic is implemented in Python.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/NombuleloMudzwiri/Minesweeper-Game

2. Navigate to the project directory:

- cd minesweeper-game

3. Run the game:

python minesweeper.py

python

## How to Play

- The grid consists of dashes ('-') and hashes ('#').
- For each dash, count the number of adjacent hash symbols (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
- The counted numbers will form a new grid representing the solution.
- Enjoy the puzzle-solving experience!
